# PWF

**Code from the PWF class [Spring 2021]**

**Language:** Python
**Prerequisites:** PBB

_This class directly follows the PBB class. It focuses specifically on functional programming._

The course covered the following concepts:

| Week(s) | Concepts                          |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1       | Intro                             |
| 2       | Review                            |
| 3 - 4   | Calling Functions                 |
| 5 - 6   | Writing Functions                 |
| 7 - 8   | Tests/Dictionaries                |
| 9 - 10  | Data Analysis/Handling Exceptions |
| 11 - 13 | Using Objects/Project             |

The class generally followed a 2-week pattern of a checkpoint and a team activity every week and a coding assignment every 2 weeks.

The class encouraged students to add something extra, so many for the assignments exceed the original assignment's requirements.

The code in this repository does not include all of the code made in this class, just many of the important assignments that I still have. They are as follows:
